# Unpacking a tuple
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.
# Unpacking is when you extract the values back into variables.
# Example

t = ("Sekh","Developer","Python")

name , role , lang = t

print(name)
print(role)     
print(lang)
